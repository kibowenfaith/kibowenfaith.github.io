Hi there! Iâ€™m **Faith Jeptoo**, a passionate **Data Analyst and AI Enthusiast** currently pursuing a **BSc. in Mathematics and Computer Science** at **Machakos University**.  

I love transforming data into meaningful insights that drive smarter decisions. My hands-on experience spans from working in the **Data Management & Analysis Department at KRA** to participating in the **Huawei ICT Competition**, **AI Center of Excellence Africa Training**, and hackathons like **#MKSUHackfest** and **#CodeYourDreams**.  

I enjoy working with tools like **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Excel**, and Iâ€™m exploring how **AI can elevate analytics**. Beyond tech, Iâ€™m an active member of **MLSA**, **GDSC**, and **Scouting**, where I channel creativity and leadership into impactful projects.
